For this project I was tasked with analysing a dataset to determine which employees at a company were most likely to leave, and how to improve the retention of the companies highest performing employees. In addition, I developed a predictive model using a Decision Tree, allowing the company to identify in particular which employees were at the greatest risk of leaving.

To conduct the data analysis and visualisation I used R, and then created a comprehensive presentation of my findings in Google Slides. Please see the pdf for the full analysis.
